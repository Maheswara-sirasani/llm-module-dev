## What is python ?
 python is high level interpretend language
 with white spaces and simple
 it supports multiple programming paradiagms:
    1.procedural programming
    2.object oriented programming
    3.functional programming


1. procedural programming 


    writing code as a sequence of steps 

     example

```python
       
       name="hello"
       print(name)


   output: hello 
```

2. object oriented programming


 organizing code into objects that contain data and code

 example

```python

   name="mahesh"
   age= 25
   qualification="B.tech"

   print(name)
   print(age)
   print(qualification) 

   output : mahesh
            25
            B.tech
```

3. functional programming :

    treating computution as evoluvation of mathemateical functions

    example
```python

 a=25
 b=35
 c=a+b
 d=a-b
 e=a*b
 f=a/b
 print(a)
 print(b)
 print(c)
 print(d)
 print(e)
 print(f)


 output :
25
35
60
-10
875
0.7142857142857143
```

## why python ?

a. readability
b. verstality
c. community support 
d. industry adaption
f. rich ecosystem


## How python works
  
    source code : write code in .py file
    compilation : python will change code to bytecode .pyc file
    interpretation : pvm executes the code (python virtual machine)
    memory allocation : python automatically allocates the memory and garbage collections
    dynamic typeing : variables are checked at run time not at a compile time

## python building blocks


    There are several number of blocks in python there like as follow

    1. Data types
    2. Variables
    3. Operators

## variables

     stores the data 
     reference to memmory location
     stores different data
     names are case sensitive

     Example :

```python
   
   name="mahesh"
   age= 25
   qualification="B.tech"
   Name="python"
   print(name)
   print(age)
   print(qualification) 
   print(Name)
   output : mahesh
            25
            B.tech
            python
```

in the above example we can clearly see that different variables that holds different data type and there refernce to memory allocations and also there case sensitive we can see it in above example it has two "names" but one is capital "N" and "n" so that reason both has different data in them.
