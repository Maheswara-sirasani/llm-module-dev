1. 🚀 Introduction
 
Framework	Year Released	Creator	Built on
 
Flask	2010	Armin Ronacher	Werkzeug + Jinja2
FastAPI	2018	Sebastián Ramírez	Starlette + Pydantic
 
 
Flask is a micro web framework focused on simplicity and flexibility.
 
FastAPI is a modern web framework for APIs, designed for performance and ease of development, especially with type hints and async support.

2. ⚙️ Core Concepts
 
Feature	Flask	FastAPI
 
Synchronous Support	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Asynchronous	❌ (Needs extra tools)	✅ Native async support
Type Hints	❌ Optional / manual	✅ Built-in with Pydantic
Automatic Docs	❌ Manual setup	✅ Auto-generated with Swagger & Redoc
Performance	🐌 Slower	🚀 Faster

3. 📦 Installation
 
# Flask
pip install flask
 
# FastAPI
pip install fastapi uvicorn
 
 
---
 
4. 🧪 Basic API Example
 
✅ Flask Example
 
from flask import Flask, jsonify
 
app = Flask(__name__)
 
@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return jsonify({"message": "Hello from Flask!"})
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
 
✅ FastAPI Example
 
from fastapi import FastAPI
 
app = FastAPI()
 
@app.get("/")
def hello():
    return {"message": "Hello from FastAPI!"}
 
To run FastAPI:
 
uvicorn main:app --reload

5. 📨 Request Handling
 
POST Request with JSON (Flask)
 
from flask import request
 
@app.route("/items", methods=["POST"])
def create_item():
    data = request.json
    return jsonify(data)
 
POST Request with JSON (FastAPI)
 
from pydantic import BaseModel
 
class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
 
@app.post("/items")
def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
 
✅ FastAPI automatically parses, validates, and returns errors for invalid types.
 
 
---
 
6. 🔐 Data Validation
 
Validation Feature	Flask	FastAPI (Pydantic)
 
Manual Schema Check	✅ Required	❌ Not Required
Built-in Error Messages	❌ Manual	✅ Automatic
Nested Schemas	❌ Tedious	✅ Easy and powerful
 
 
 
---
 
7. ⚡ Performance Benchmark
 
Framework	Requests/sec	Time per request
 
Flask	~200-500	2ms - 5ms
FastAPI	~2000+	<1ms
 
 
✅ FastAPI is faster because it is based on Starlette and supports async.
 
 
---
 
8. 🔄 Async Support
 
Flask (Requires Quart or asyncio hack)
 
# Flask doesn't support async by default.
# You can use Quart instead for async support
 
FastAPI
 
import asyncio
 
@app.get("/async-data")
async def get_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return {"message": "Async worked!"}
 
 
---
 
9. 🔧 Dependency Injection
 
Flask
 
# Manual injection via decorators or context
 
FastAPI
 
from fastapi import Depends
 
def get_db():
    return "MySQL_Connection"
 
@app.get("/users")
def get_users(db=Depends(get_db)):
    return {"db": db}
 
✅ FastAPI makes dependency management modular and clean.

10. 🧾 API Documentation
 
Feature	Flask	FastAPI
 
Swagger UI	❌ External tool	✅ Built-in (localhost/docs)
ReDoc	❌ External tool	✅ Built-in (/redoc)
OpenAPI Spec	❌ Manual	✅ Auto-generated
 
 
 
---
 
11. 🔧 Use Cases
 
Use Case	Flask	FastAPI
 
Traditional Web Apps (HTML)	✅ Great	❌ Not Ideal
REST APIs	✅ Good	✅ Excellent
ML Model Serving	❌ Slower	✅ Recommended
Async APIs (WebSockets, etc.)	❌ Complex	✅ Supported
Realtime Apps (Chat, etc.)	❌ Needs tools	✅ Native

12. 📊 Pros and Cons
 
Flask ✅ Pros:
 
Easy to learn for beginners
 
Tons of extensions
 
Mature and stable
 
Great for HTML/CSS/Jinja projects
 
 
Flask ❌ Cons:
 
Slower for APIs
 
Manual validation
 
No async
 
No built-in docs
 
 
FastAPI ✅ Pros:
 
High performance
 
Async + type safety
 
Auto docs and OpenAPI
 
Great for microservices / ML APIs
 
 
FastAPI ❌ Cons:
 
Slight learning curve with Pydantic
 
Not ideal for full HTML web apps
 
Still evolving (less mature)

13. 🎯 When to Use What?
 
Scenario	Recommendation
 
Simple web page (Jinja, forms)	Flask
Fast, type-safe REST APIs	FastAPI
Async APIs with background jobs	FastAPI
Migrating legacy Python project	Flask
Machine Learning model serving	FastAPI
